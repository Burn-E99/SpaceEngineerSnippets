# Space Engineers Programmable Block API Documentation
This documentation is derived from decompiling one of the DLLs in the Space Engineers game.  I have curated what parts of the DLL to only keep what is needed.  I may also add in my own notes onto the decompiled comments, but these will be restricted to items that I have used.

Sometime in the future, I may rewrite this into a proper doc page (along with the other snippets I have).

# IMPORTANT NOTE
I DO NOT OWN THIS DOCUMENTATION.  I SIMPLY USED A PROGRAM CALLED ILSpy (https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy) TO DECOMPILE THE FOLLOWING DLLS:

* API1: `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\Sandbox.Common.dll`
  * Packages `Sandbox.ModAPI` and `Sandbox.ModAPI.Ingame` were kept and all others were thrown out
* API2: `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\SpaceEngineers\Bin64\SpaceEngineers.Game.dll`
  * Packages `SpaceEngineers.Game.ModAPI` and `SpaceEngineers.Game.Ingame` were kept and all others were thrown out

IF Keen Software House (or an employee of Keen Software House) WOULD LIKE THE DECOMPILED DLLS REMOVED, PLEASE EMAIL ME AT `ean@burne99.com` AND I WILL PROMPTLY REMOVE THE DECOMPILED DLLS.
