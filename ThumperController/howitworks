this script will regulate the extension and rotation of a "thumper driller"
most of this document is handwritten and will not be transferred here, to short of it:
depth and radial cuts have grouped stages for unlocking and extending
thumper will be able to phone home to another grid when something goes wrong (ie grid taking any damage, rotor stuck)
