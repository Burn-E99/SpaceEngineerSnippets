# Space Engineers Programmable Block API Documentation
This documentation is derived from decompiling one of the DLLs in the Space Engineers game.  I have curated what parts of the DLL to only keep what is needed, and have also made this into a more readable format.  I may also add in my own notes onto the decompiled comments, but these will be restricted to items that I have used.
